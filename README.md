# libft

## Overview

**libft** is a custom C library that reimplements a set of standard functions from the C standard library, along with additional utility functions. The goal of this project is to deepen the understanding of basic C functions, memory management, and string manipulation by recreating commonly used tools from scratch.

This library can be used as a foundation for future projects, providing a reliable and consistent set of functions.

## Features

- Memory management functions (`ft_memset`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`, etc.)
- String manipulation functions (`ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strncpy`, `ft_strcat`, `ft_strchr`, etc.)
- Character checking and conversion functions (`ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_toupper`, `ft_tolower`, etc.)
- Additional utility functions such as `ft_itoa`, `ft_split`, `ft_strjoin`, etc.
