# libft

## Overview

**libft** is a custom C library that reimplements a set of standard functions from the C standard library, along with additional utility functions. The goal of this project is to deepen the understanding of basic C functions, memory management, and string manipulation by recreating commonly used tools from scratch.

This library can be used as a foundation for future projects, providing a reliable and consistent set of functions.

## Features

- Memory management functions (`ft_memset`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`, etc.)
- String manipulation functions (`ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strncpy`, `ft_strcat`, `ft_strchr`, etc.)
- Character checking and conversion functions (`ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_toupper`, `ft_tolower`, etc.)
- Additional utility functions such as `ft_itoa`, `ft_split`, `ft_strjoin`, etc.


## Competencies Acquired

- **Recreation of Standard Library Functions**: Mastery of fundamental C programming concepts by reimplementing essential functions from the C standard library, such as `atoi`, `strlcat`, `calloc` and much more like `split`, `strtrim`...

- **Memory Management**: Deep understanding of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, ensuring efficient use of resources and avoiding memory leaks.

- **Pointer Manipulation**: Proficiency in working with pointers, including pointer arithmetic, double pointers, and their use in dynamic data structures.

- **Custom Data Structures**: Development of custom data structures, such as linked lists, to manage and organize data effectively.

- **Linked List Implementation**: Practical experience in creating and manipulating linked lists, including node creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal.

- **Modular Code Design**: Ability to write modular, reusable, and well-structured code, adhering to strict coding standards.

- **Debugging and Testing**: Strengthened debugging and testing skills, ensuring the reliability and robustness of implemented functions.
